## Git Tutorial

We'll start by running through a tutorial covering configuration, committing changes, GitHub, pushing and pulling, tagging, branching, and merging.

This should be mostly familiar, perhaps will a few tasks you've not met before.
The intention is to give a demonstration of a typical workflow.
It will also serve as a checkpoint, making sure that we have our credentials set up to access GitHub from our terminal.

### Open a new directory in the terminal

To start, we want to create a new directory, and have a terminal open in this directory.
This step will change depending on the operating system (OS) we're working will, and will be demonstrated in the classroom.

### Check the version of git

From the terminal, we want to confirm that git is installed.

``` none
$ git --version
git version 2.45.0.windows.1
```

Your output may change depending on your OS and how recently git was installed.
