Prior to the start of the course, attendees should have git, a terminal and a code editor installed, and have a GitHub account with credentials configured.
We provide suggestions below, but attendees can use alternatives they are already comfortable with (except for git, which is mandatory).

If you encounter any difficulties with installation please contact the Exeter RSE group <rse-group@exeter.ac.uk>.

## Git and a Terminal

Git can be obtained from <https://git-scm.com/>.
For windows users, the git installer comes with a terminal app Git Bash.
For Mac and linux users, a terminal comes with your system.

## Code Editor

The lessons will include demonstrations with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Attendees familiar with another IDE or editor (such as RStudio or vim) will be able to follow along with all the exercises.

## GitHub Account and Credentials

Attendees can register for a free GitHub account at <https://github.com/>.
Please follow the instructions at [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens), making a note of your username and personal access token.
